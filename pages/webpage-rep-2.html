            <h2>MIKE PATEY</h2>
            <h3>SPANISH FORK, UT</h3>
            <h6>2018 STOL DRAG WORLD CHAMPION</h6>
            <img src="/images/Mike.webp" alt="Mike" />
            <p>
              Mike Patey was born in Gresham, Oregon, along with twin brother,
              Mark, right in the middle of 11 children. He and his wife,
              Chandra, who is a pilot as well, have 4 children. His aviation
              journey began in a 1971 Cessna 172L in 2002. He subsequently
              earned his single/multi-engine land and sea, commercial,
              instrument, and rotorcraft ratings along with various
              endorsements. His natural energy and knack for engineering feed
              his love for the challenge to circumvent the norms and “build it
              better.” This drives his passion to create and build his own
              airplanes, which he uses for competitive racing, STOL, flying his
              family, business, and playing with his fellow “Flying Cowboys.” He
              holds several aviation records and enthusiastically shares his
              process and adventures via his YouTube channel.
